# VixenControl

Control Vixen 3 with a raspberry pi and a button. This repository has a single program file `vixenControl.py`, a way to start it `vixenControl.service`, and a few template files to follow when configuring the pi.

You should follow the [Wiki](https://github.com/dixonwille/VixenControl/wiki) to setup your instance.
